# InfoMatrix_Sarun_Sln
InfoMatrix Sarun Sln :
The application is built using Visual Studio 2015, with .NET Framework 4.5.2
The solution contains the following:
1.  A Windows Application used to display the result.
2.  A UnitTest Application using NUnit Framework, for unit testing the application.
Since I was free to use any approach, I went with simple Windows application. I can even do well with using Webforms or MVC. 
Also there are multiple ways of doing this. Either using color code in a single resultset/grid and give a legend what each color refers to; 
or multiple grids for each result. 

Steps to run the applications:
1.  Download the Zip file "InfoMatrix_Sarun_Sln-master.zip".
2.  Unzip it in a folder.
3.  Click open that folder, double click on "InfoMatrix_Sarun.sln" and open with Visual Studio 2015. 
4.  Two projects exists in the solution
    a. InfoMatrix_Sarun.csproj
    b. InfoMatrix_Sarun_UnitTest.csproj
For viewing Bet result
5.  Right click on InfoMatrix_Sarun.csproj. > Set as startup project.
6.  Rebuild the solution.
7.  Execute Run.
8.  One single window will display all required information
For unit testing
9.  Open NUnit application (desktop application)
10. File > Open Project 
11. Navigate to bin\Debug\InfoMatrix_Sarun_UnitTest.dll folder
12. Execute Run.

Thank you
